Lab 3
*1.	Create a Box class with width, height and depth instance variables. Use the constructor to initialize the instance variables. Write a volume() method that returns the volume of the box. Create two objects of box and display their volumes.
*2.	Write a program to demonstrate this keyword.
*3.	Write a program called Calculate with various forms of sum method. Demonstrate the concept of method overloading.
*4.  Create a Student class with id, name, and age instance variables. Use the constructor overloading concept to initialize the instance variables. Write a display method to display the details of a student. 
*5.	Write a program to demonstrate copy constructor.
*6.	Write a program to find the factorial of a given number using recursion.
*7.  Write a program that calculates the sum of the first 10 numbers using recursion. 
*8.  Write a program to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
*9.	Write a program to demonstrate static keyword in the instance variable, method and block.
